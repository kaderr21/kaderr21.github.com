# About

My name is Maciej, I was born in 2005 and I've developed a large passion for IT. I am currently learning how to code with python, I also know basics of C# and C++ because of some classes when I went to high school. My dream is to work in IT, either in networking, IT Security or any type of architectural work. Follow me on my journey! (My plan is to keep everything to show people that anything is possible!)

## Education

- Polhemskolan, Lund (High School)
  - Graduated in Information technology

## Certificates

- Google Cybersecurity Certificate
  - Skills achieved:
    - Python, SQL, SIEM, Linux, Infosec, Cryptography.

### Coding projects!

[Link to my random python projects](./python.md).

The link is there to both show my progress and to show what I can and know. Later on I will also learn other programming languages like C++, C# etc.

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
